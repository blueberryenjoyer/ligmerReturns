    <p>
        in 1444 i killed the kings of hungary, bohemia, and poland <br>
        then i went on to braums and become an ice cream enjoyer <br>
        however, braums was controlled by the agents of evil <br>
        so i left braums and started my own company, "the united nations" <br>
        <br>
        nowadays i control the entire world
        <br>
