        What, dont believe me? Alright, the truth then. I have a dream. That one day every dev in this economy will
        control their own destiny. An industry of the truly free, dammit. An internet of functions, not comments,
        ruled by passion,
        not job requirements! Where the end user changes to suit the website, not the other way around. Where html and
        css
        are back where they belong: in the hands of the developers! Where every dev is free to think - to code - for
        himself! Javascript is diseased. Rotten to the
        core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the repository clean. BURN IT DOWN! And
        from
        the ashes, a new website will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The front-end will be purged and the strongest will
        thrive - free to code as they see fit, they'll make the internet great again!... In my new internet, people will
        hack
        and code for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. not for work experience! Not for what they're told is right.
        Every man will
        be free to create his own websites!
