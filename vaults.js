// JavaScript creates so much more functionality for a site and automates processes.
//You are building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes in a combination.
//Use the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three variables.Each variable will be the result of each calculation(three in total).
//The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39. You must use three different arithmetic operators that will generate each individual number, 
//then display the combination on the HTML page, or in an alert popup.

let var1 = 15 - 5
let var2 = 10 * 4
let var3 = 78 / 2
let halfString = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"
console.log(`${halfString} ${var1} - ${var2} - ${var3}`)

//why do i need comments to explain string concatenation? im literally doing one operation.
//like yeah so my plan is to make the variables, and then add them together.
//what am i supposed to explain, the syntax? i didnt invent the syntax
