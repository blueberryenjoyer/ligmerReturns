        what, dont believe me? alright, the truth then. I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will
        control their own destiny. A nation of the truly free, dammit. A nation of action, not words, ruled by strength,
        not committee! Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice
        are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself!
        Fuck all these lawyers and bureaucrats. Fuck this 24-hour Internet spew of trivia and
        celebrity bullshit! Fuck American pride! Fuck the media! FUCK ALL OF IT! America is diseased. Rotten to the
        core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from
        the ashes, a new America will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged and the strongest will
        thrive - free to live as they see fit, they'll make America great again!... In my new America, people will die
        and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. not for oil! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will
        be free to fight his own wars!
